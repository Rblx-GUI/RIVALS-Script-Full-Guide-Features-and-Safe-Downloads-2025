### Step 3: Load and Execute the Script

Paste your script or script loader into the executor. Here's an example loader:

## 🧪 Sample Script Snippet (Educational Use Only)

Here’s a basic example of a light auto combo logic:

```lua
while wait(0.1) do
   local enemy = findNearestEnemy()
   if enemy then
      game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Remotes.Attack:FireServer("Light", enemy)
      wait(0.2)
      game:GetService("ReplicatedStorage").Remotes.Attack:FireServer("Heavy", enemy)
